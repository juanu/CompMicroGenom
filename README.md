This is a collection of scripts used for the comparative analysis of microbial genomes. Starting from a GBK file,
either from Genbank or RAST, the scripts can be used to prepare data to run orthoMCL, analye the results, generate
alignments, trees and perform selection analysis. In addition, another set of scripts can be used to look for evidence
of horizontal gene transfer using Darkhorse.

There are also tools for importing dumps from IMG

The main requirements are Python 2.7+ (not Python 3), and two libraries:
- PyCogent http://pycogent.org
- Biopython http://biopython.org

In addition, to run the alignment and tree script, Mafft and Fasttree need to be installed and accessible globally
